# Bookshelf-Apps-FrontEnd-Web-Dev
This project is my submission for Dicoding Create Front-End Web for Beginners Course. I use media queries to customize layouts on various device screen sizes and localStorage to store book data. Website contents are currently written in Bahasa Indonesia.

Here are the criterias:

1. Bookshelf Apps must be able to add new book data, stored book data is a JavaScript object.
2. Bookshelf Apps must have 2 Bookshelves; "Not finished reading" and "Finished reading". "Not finished reading" only stores books which isComplete property is false. "Finished reading" only saves books which isComplete property is true.
3. Books displayed on the shelf must be able to be moved between the two bookshelves.
4. Books displayed on the shelf must be able to be removed.
5. Use localStorage in storing book data.

For this project I added a search feature to filter the books displayed on the shelves according to the book titles written in the search field and also added a custom dialog confirmation when removing a book and when there is no books while using the search books feature.
